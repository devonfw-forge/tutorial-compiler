2. Optional: The version of the ide to install
#### example
restoreDevonfwIde(["java","mvn"], "2020.08.001")
#### details 
In the Katacoda environment the installation of the devonfw IDE is executed in a startup script.
***

### restoreWorkspace 
#### parameter
1. (Optional): 
    * Name of the workspace repository {"workspace": string} (Default is the playbook-name)
    * local workspace {"local": boolean} (Default is false)

#### arguments 
**User**(Optional)
    flag: --user 
    value: GitHub-username (Default is 'devonfw-tutorials')

You can use a forked workspace-repository, if you add the username as argument. If the runner cannot find the workspace repository in the your repositories, it will use devonfw-tutorials instead. 

**Branch**(Optional)
    flag: --branch
    value: the working branch (Default is its default-branch)

You can use a different branch, if you add the working branch as argument. If the runner cannot find the branch in the cloned repository, it will use the default branch instead. 

buildRun.sh --user [username] --branch [branch]

#### example

restoreWorkspace() 
will clone "https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/[playbook-name]" into the workspace directory.

restoreWorkspace({"workspace": [name]})
will clone "https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/[name]" into the workspace directory.

**buildRun.sh --user [GitHub-name] --branch [branch]**
restoreWorkspace()
will run "git clone https://github.com/[GitHub-name]/[playbook-name]" and checkout in branch [branch]

#### details  
**workspace** 
    The default name of the workspace repository is a concatenation of "workspace-" and the name of your playbook-folder. 
    If you want to use another repository as workspace, you can specify the ending with {"workspace": [name]}.
    **example**
    "workspace-devon4ng" -> {"workspace" : "devon4ng"}

**local** 
    You can use a local repository as workspace in your tutorial.
    Clone the forked repository next to the tutorial-compiler folder and set the "local"-parameter to true {"local": true}
    
    |--tutorial-compiler
    |--tutorials 
    |--workspace-devon4ng

### changeWorkspace
#### parameter
1. path to a new workspace (relative to working directory)
#### example 
changeWorkspace("devonfw/workspaces/project")
will set the workspace directory to "[working directory]/devonfw/workspaces/project"

2. (Optional) Path of the file to get the content from. Relative to the playbook directory
#### example 
createFile("cobigenexample/core/src/main/java/com/example/application/cobigenexample/customermanagement/dataaccess/api/CustomerEntity.java", "files/CustomerEntity.java")

***

### changeFile
#### parameter 
1. Path of the file to be changed (relative path to the workspace directory)
2. 
 *  Path of the file to get the content from or a string, that should be inserted.
 * (Optional) Name of a placeholder 
 * (Optional) Line number where u want to insert your code. (Possible lines are: 1...n+1 for N = number of existing lines. File cant be empty) 
#### example 
changeFile("cobigenexample/core/src/main/java/com/example/application/cobigenexample/customermanagement/dataaccess/api/CustomerEntity.java", { "file": "files/Placeholder.java", "placeholder": "private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;" })
#### details
##### Path of the file to get the content from or a string, that should be inserted.
If you want to add content from a file: 
{"file": "[path]"}
If you want to add a string to a file: 
{"content": "[string]"}
If you want to add different contents for the katacoda and console runner, then use the properties "fileConsole" and "fileKatacoda" or "contentConsole" and "contentKatacoda":
{"fileConsole": "[pathToConsoleFile]", "fileKatacoda": "[pathToKatacodaFile]"}
If you want to insert some content at a specific line, then use "lineNumber" and dont use a placeholder: 
{"lineNumber": "[Line]"}

example:{...,"placeholder": "private int age;"}
| Before | Content or File | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
|<p>private int age;<br><br>public String getFirstname() {<br>return firstname;<br>}<br></p>|<p>private int age;<br><br>private String company;<br>public String getCompany() {<br>return firstname;<br>}<br>public void setCompany(String company) {<br>this.company = company;<br>}</p>|<p>private int age;<br><br>private String company;<br>public String getCompany() {<br>return firstname;<br>}<br>public void setCompany(String company) {<br>this.company = company;<br><br>public String getFirstname() {<br>return firstname;<br>}<br></p>|

##### Prerequisite
The usage of the line number function requires having VSCode installed on your System. Not having VSCode installed will not create any output for Katacoda.

##### Name of the placeholder
If you want to insert content into your code between two existing lines, take the previous line as your placeholder or use the option to insert at a line number. Add your placeholder into the new file or string, otherwise it will be replaced entirely.

A placeholder is optional. If you do not define a placeholder, the content in the existing file will be simply replaced by the new content.

Please try not to use custom placeholders. Keep in mind that you might want to build the project before changing them. Custom placeholders with a comment-syntax (e.g. "//PLACEHOLDER") will be removed by the console-environment and others might cause errors.

The option to insert at a linenumber uses a placeholder inserted by a script and just adds it at the step you also insert the content.
