<% if(lineNumber) { %>Inserting the content into a specific line number can be done by a left mouse click into the line *<%= lineNumber%>* and using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+v. Not every editor provides line numbers, if they are missing you have to count the numbers yourself.
<%}else if(placeholder) {%>To replace the content with a specific Placeholder you have to locate the placeholder in the file.
