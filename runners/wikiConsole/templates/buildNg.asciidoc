Build an Angular Project
========================

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* You need to have either installed the devonfw-ide with an Angular installation or installed https://angular.io/[Angular] seperatly on your system.
* You need to have created or downloaded a Angular Project to a local directory.

For this tutorial navigate to the Angular directory by executing `cd <%= angularPath; %>` in your terminal.

Execution
~~~~~~~~~
<% if(outputPath){ %>
If you want to compile the app to a custom output directory, you can execute the command `ng build --output-path <%= outputPath; %>`. The output path must me relative to your current workspace.
<% } else { %>
Now you can execute the console command `ng build` on both Linux and Windows. 
This will compile your Angular app into an output directory named `dist/` by default.
<% } %>
