buildNg command
=============

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* You need to have either installed the devonfwIDE with an angular installation or installed https://angular.io/[Angular] seperatly on your system.
* You need to have created or downloaded a Angular Project to a local directory.

For this tutorial move to the angular directory by executing `cd <%= angularPath; %>`

Execution
~~~~~~
<% if(outputPath){ %>
If you want to compile the app to a custom output directory, you can execute the command `ng build --output-path (<%= outputPath; %>). The output path must me relative to your current workspace.
<% } else { %>
Now you can execute the console command `ng build` on both Linux and Windows. 
This will compile your angular app into an output directory named dist/ by default.
<% } %>
