The next step is to install globally Angular CLI. 

`npm install -g @angular/cli`{{execute}}

After a while you will be asked if you like to share anonymous usage data with the Angular Team at Google. 
Either choose 

`y`{{execute}} or `n`{{execute}}

Now switch to the angular folder in jump-the-queue directory. 

`cd jump-the-queue/angular`{{execute}}

After that install the dependencies in the local folder. 

`npm install`{{execute}}

This will take some time.

The following two steps are only needed in this tutorial. Normally you can simply execute "ng serve", open the https://localhost:4200/ and start using the app.
